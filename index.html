            <h1 id="why"> Why? </h1>
            <h2 class="qna">Why did I make this website and blog?</h2>
            <p> It's not that I have money to throw away on a domain name. I made this website to actually journal
                my
                life.</p>
            <h2 class="qna"> Now the question is, why do I want to journal my life?</h2>
            <p> I actually feel that, for the past few months, life has been moving pretty fast since I joined
                college. It seems
                like I am not able to give my brain the time to self-reflect and appreciate the things happening
                in
                my life.</p>
            <h2 class="qna">
                Another question is, why would I want to show my journal to the whole world? </h2>
            <p> Actually, those who know me are aware that I am a very reserved person and talk very little
                about my life and
                what I do. This is just my nature, and I can't fight against it. Very few people know about
                my
                life, and even
                then, only to some extent. That's why I am making this website—to express myself more.
                Another
                reason is that I
                have a certain level of social anxiety.</p>
            <h2 class="qna">One final question, and the most important one: why should you read my journals?
            </h2>
            <p>This question is hard to answer, as everyone has different interests. I will create blogs
                with real value instead
                of being an empty shell. This means I will ensure that you learn something new and
                meaningful after reading my
                blog. I will also strive to make my blogs interesting and easy to read.<br><br>

                I aim to focus on quality rather than quantity, which means my blogs may be few and far
                between. Everyone has
                different interests—some might love my journal, some might ignore it, and some might
                dislike
                it. That's fine. At
                the end of the day, it's up to you.<br><br>

                Anyway, I hope you enjoy! </p>

            <!-- <h1 id="journey"> My ML journey</h1>
            <h2>Backgroud of my coding journey</h2>
            <p>So, when I was in 10th grade, my brother told me to learn C++ as he is in the IT sector and knows what
                the industry is asking for. I tried C++ for a few days and hated it—its weird syntax and all that stuff.
                I hated it from the bottom of my heart.<br><br> Then, after the JEE exam, I picked up C++ again to see
                if my
                mindset had changed, but to my surprise, it hadn't. At this point, I almost gave up on coding and
                thought it wasn't for me, but later, something was about to change. </p>
            <h2>College, Coding, and Python</h2>
            <p>So when i entered college, btw my branch is chemical eng, i had a subject with code name CHC-101, it was
                a programming subject and was of python programming related to chemical engineering. As i hated coding
                at that time, i thought that it will take toll on me.<br><br> But something was different , something
                that cpp
                didn't had-"good syntax". I cant help but love python. As i already liked problem solving , i started
                to fell in love with python.And with time , i got good at python. It was my first good encounter with
                coding in my life.</p>
            <h2>Road not taken, field that is still undiscoverd</h2>
            <p>The semester break started, and I had a lot of free time. I saw my batchmates doing C++, DSA, Leetcode,
                and other competitive programming. I'm not saying that they are wrong for doing that, but I hated that
                type of stuff. I know it helps get the job at the end of the day, but I still didn't like it. I wanted
                to do something new and different. So, I explored and discovered that Python can be extended to machine
                learning. I then started learning machine learning.</p>
            <h2>Finding Resources </h2>
            <p>When I started, I searched for resources on YouTube and found that there weren't many machine learning
                tutorials available, so finding good resources was crucial. First, I learned Numpy, then Pandas. Later,
                I came across some roadmaps and discovered Andrew Ng's machine learning course. I tried it for a week,
                but it didn't feel right. I continued searching on YouTube and other places, but I couldn't find quality
                resources. At this point, I felt hopeless and switched to web development. However, I decided to give
                myself one last chance. That's when I discovered CodeBasics, a YouTube channel dedicated to machine
                learning. The content was amazing, and I felt like I was levitating with excitement. His machine
                learning and deep learning tutorials are excellent, and I would highly recommend them to everyone.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Now, I am learning more about machine learning. I even took part in a club competition at our college. It
                was a basic class categorizer for animals. I documented it in my <a
                    href="https://github.com/mehul-here/vlg-competition" target="_blank" class="github_anchor"> Github
                    repo</a> and anyone
                interested can check it out. Let's see if I get recruited or not. Even if I don't get recruited, it was
                still a good journey.I will link some good resources in Tldr section. Thank you for reading till the
                end. I hope you have a good day. </p>
            <p>I will improve my website for sure in future.</p>
